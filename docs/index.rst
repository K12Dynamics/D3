Welcome to D3's documentation!
==============================

Dynamic District Dashboard (D3) is a dashboard-style software system that gathers, organizes, and presents key information to stakeholders of K-12 school districts. It also provides the tools necessary for integrating and analyzing school district data. D3 works on traditional desktops and laptops; it is also compatible with handheld devices such as smart phones and tablets.
