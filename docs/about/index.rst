Accessibility
==============================

Web Accessibility, simply put, is the creation of sites and applications that can be fully experienced by the broadest number of users. That includes disabled users, who typically visit the sites we create with the help of assistive technologies such as screen readers.

For the most basic, text-driven web experiences, these technologies work well, and disabled users greatly benefit. However, the Web has exploded well beyond the realm of text-based experiences in the last decade, including the emergence of Rich Internet Applications (RIA), such as D3. Assistive technologies have struggled to keep up.

We are committed to a continued investment in supporting assistive technologies to better aid disabled D3 users. We are working towards providing things like full keyboard support, high-contrast visual elements, text-based equivalents of non-text elements and by adhering to standards like WAI-ARIA, WCAG 2.0, and Section 508.

The web development technologies used to build D3 were chosen in part because of their recognition and commitment to including accessibility support.
