# Favorites

The Favorites feature provides a way for each user to mark library items for quick access.

Each favorite can be launch with just two clicks. First, click the pull-out menu icon. Your Favorites are automatically displayed as the first tab in the menu (identified by a star icon). Second, click a favorited item to launch it.

Your favorites are organized in alphabetical order. 

## Managing Favorites

Most items in D3 include an `Add to favorites` option in the sidebar. Clicking this option will automatically add the current item to your list of favorites.

If the item is already in your favorites, a `Remove from favorites` option will be available instead.

Once you have identified an item as a favorite, the addition option `Set as home screen` become available. Clicking this will cause the favorited item to be automatically dispalyed as the initial screen when you login.
