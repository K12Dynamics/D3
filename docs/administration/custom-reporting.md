# Custom Reporting

While the D3 focus is to deliver online, real-time analytics, we recognize that customers may also want to leverage the availability of the underlying data warehouse to as a data source for more traditional operational reporting needs.

There are many capable report creation and delivery software products available in the market. Rather than trying to compete with these products, we believe our customers are best served by enabling access to the data warehouse so they can choose the reporting software that best fits their needs.

To ensure security, access to the data warehouse is only permitted through a site-to-site VPN connection between your corporate network and the D3 infrastructure. 

Any reporting solution that can connect to an OLEDB data source can be used. If you do not already have a product in mind, consider Telerik Reporting. Alternatively, for simpler needs and if you already have an installation of SQL Server, consider SQL Server Reporting Services.

Please contact us if you are interested in establishing a connection to the D3 data warehouse. Our technical team will coordinate the process to establish secure connection.
