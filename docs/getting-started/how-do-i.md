## How to Set Your Home Screen

The home screen is the view displayed in D3 immediately after you login. Any favorited item can be set to appear as your home screen.

Steps to set your home screen:
1. Open the item from the main menu.
2. If the item is not currently a favorite, click `Add to favorites` in the sidebar.
3. In the sidebar, click `Set as home screen`.

Performing these steps will assign a home screen if you did not already have one set, or replace an existing one if you had previously set a home screen.

## How to Logout from D3

Click the icon on the far left of the top bar to open the main menu. In the footer of the pull-out menu panel, you will see the name of the currently logged in user and a logout button. Simply click this button to logout the user. The D3 sign-in page will then be displayed. 

Note that you can also just close your browser (or browser tab) to effectively logout from D3.
