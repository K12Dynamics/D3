Login

D3 requires every user to log in. For users coming in via the districtâ€™s secure portal, the login credentials entered at the district portal will be passed through automatically to D3 using single sign on. However, for users navigating directly to D3, the login screen will be displayed (depicted below) and the user must enter a valid user name and password for the given school district organization.
