## How to Set Your Home Screen

The home screen is the view displayed in D3 immediately after you login. Any favorited item can be set to appear as your home screen.

Steps to set your home screen:
1. Open the item from the main menu.
2. If the item is not currently a favorite, click `Add to favorites` in the sidebar.
3. In the sidebar, click `Set as home screen`.

Performing these steps will assign a home screen if you did not already have one set, or replace an existing one if you had previously set a home screen.
