# Roadmap

We operate in a dynamic environment and maintain a heavy focus on responding to customer requests, so many new features introduced into D3 come from opportunity and need. However, we also maintain an internal roadmap of major new features planned for D3. At this point, we can't provide a timeline for these items, but we want to share with our customers what our longer range plans are for D3.

We invite feedback and suggestions for refining our roadmap. Please contact your K-12 Dynamics Account Manager to provide feedback.

## #1 TEA Data Integration

We've already made significant progress on this roadmap item. Within D3, you can now view more than 110 charts organized within 10 dashboards of TEA TAPR (Texas Academic Performance Reporting) data. Includes are both longitudinal charts for your district as well as charts comparing the most recently published school year with other districts.

Future enhancements will include the ability for districts to create their own sets of comparison districts (currently we set these up for the customer), the ability to view campus level details, and the inclusion of finance data (which is a TEA data set separate from TAPR).

## #2 Administrative Management of Library Items

Currently, users can create and modify their own charts and dashboards, which are stored in the My Items folder. However, creating a published item that is visible in the main library is a task performed by the K-12 Dynamics support team. While our turnaround time is usually next business day once we have obtained requirements for the new library and the user roles who should see it, we strategically want this to to be an entirely self-service experience for our customers.

## #3 Classroom-Based Experience for Teachers and Principals

We intend to build a tailored experience for teachers and their principals, which automatically organizes information for students within the classes taught a given teacher. Teachers will be able to visualized analytic for just the students they teach, either collectively or by class. Principals will be able to take advantage of a similar experience by first choosing a teacher at the campus they are responsible for. We anticipate this experience will reach into dashboards, charts, scorecards, and explorer, to provide a complete experience oriented around the class room.   

## #4 Graduation Planning

Many school districts use a software application for tracking requirements for student graduations. We want to incorporate this data into D3, potentially augmented by incorporating outside credits. Using this information, D3 can visualize graduation planning details.

## #5 Cross-Functional and Statistical Analysis Improvements

Our analysts are still investigating the potential opportunities of incorporating more advantage analytics into D3. Expect to see more trend, correlation, and regression analysis, including the ability to mine your data to identify patterns between different measures. This will help you answer questions like why was there a drop in attendance on a particular day, or why were classroom grades higher in one particular grading period.

## #6 Publish to Portal

This capability will allow charts to be built in D3, and then embedded directly into the customer's ISD website with interactive features to configure the visualization display and data. Think of it as a mini-D3 for your own website.

## #7 Forecasting

Forecasting is a hot topic nowadays in K-12 education. We're watching developments in this area closely, and identifying opportunities to deliver more value to our customers through D3.
